Aqua is a Python-based aquarium simulation program that allows you to create and manage a virtual aquatic environment with fish and crabs. With Aqua, you can watch as your aquatic creatures swim, interact, and grow within their tank.

## Features

- **Customizable Aquarium**: Set the dimensions of your aquarium to create the perfect environment for your aquatic creatures.

- **Simulation**: Watch as your aquatic creatures move around, age, and interact with each other and their environment.
- **Feeding**: Keep your aquatic creatures healthy by feeding them regularly.
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes in your aquarium in real-time as the simulation progresses.
